    /// A Blob object represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data. Blobs represent data that isn't necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. The File interface is based on Blob, inheriting blob functionality and expanding it to support files on the user's system.
    /// An easy way to construct a Blob is by invoking the Blob constuctor. Another way is to use the slice() method to create a blob that contains a subset of another blob's data.
